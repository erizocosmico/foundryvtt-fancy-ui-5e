# foundryvtt-fancy-ui-5e

This module adds a new fancier UI for D&D 5e system in FoundryVTT.

### Features

- Character panel so the player can manage their character without opening the character sheet.
  - Manage hit points.
  - Roll actions (weapons, spells, ...)
  - Roll ability, save and skill checks.
- Party panel so all players and the GM can see the current party and manage their hit points.
- Nicer UI for the sidebar and chat messages.
- Hidden navigation, hotbar and player list (except for GM).
- Controls are minimized unless hovered.
- Foundry logo is hidden (in the future it will be replaceable with your own).

This set of features is meant to remove the things that take space in the screen and are not needed while providing quality of life improvements for using the characters as well as a nicer UI. This is how I like my setup, but not necessarily how everyone will like to play with FoundryVTT.

### Requirements

- [BetterRolls5e](https://github.com/RedReign/FoundryVTT-BetterRolls5e/tree/master/betterrolls5e)
- [character-actions-list-5e](https://github.com/ElfFriend-DnD/foundryvtt-dnd5eCharacterActions)

### Nice to have

The module has styles to change the UI of the following character sheet.

- [mybeyond-theme](https://fvtt-modules.eschmann.online/)

If it's not present, the styles will just not be applied.

### TODO

UI is in spanish, I have to translate it to english as well.
